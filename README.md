# FRC Team 449: Scouting App
Android scouting app for FRC with Bluetooth data transfer. Designed for use on 7" Kindle fires.

Development for Infinite Recharge specific data fields is underway (but not ready for use).

__To be used with the Python server:__ https://github.com/carter-wilson/ScoutingServer

This is version 2 of our 2019 scouting app: https://github.com/carter-wilson/DeepSpaceScoutingApp
