# Scouting App Base
Android scouting app for FRC. Has underlying structure, Bluetooth communication, and game independent fields, but does not have game specific fields. A fork will be made for Infinite Recharge when it is released.

<b>This app is in early stages of development. It is not ready for use.</b>

This is version 2 of our 2019 scouting app: https://github.com/carter-wilson/DeepSpaceScoutingApp / https://github.com/carter-wilson/ScoutingServer

### Contact the developer
If you need any help setting up and using this app, developing a scouting app of your own (or a derivative of this one), or anything else, I am more than happy to help.
You can email me at <carter47w@gmai.com>, or find me (Carter|449) on the FRC or CHS discord and send me a DM.
