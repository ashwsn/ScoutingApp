# Scouting App Base
Android scouting app for FRC. Has underlying structure, Bluetooth communication, and game independent fields, but does not have game specific fields. A fork will be made for Infinite Recharge when it is released.

<b>This app is in early stages of development. It is not ready for use.</b>

Version 2 of our 2019 scouting app, https://github.com/carter-wilson/DeepSpaceScoutingApp / https://github.com/carter-wilson/ScoutingServer
